# Script for DDEC Indicators 004 to 007
# Author: Gamaliel Lamboy Rodr√≠guez
# Version: 1.0
# Description:
# This script partially automatizes the obtainment of Indicators 004-007 from
# their database. It assumes an incremental updating of the data, and that the
# recent year of database is being manipulated. For time trends, the user must
# supply the database year, which is then assigned as the main variable name.
# The resulting file can afterwards be joined with the cumulative
# (time-series) dataset.
