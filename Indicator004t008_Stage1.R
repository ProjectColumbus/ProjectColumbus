# Script for DDEC Indicators 004 to 008
# Author: Gamaliel Lamboy Rodr√≠guez
# Version: 1.0
# Description:
# This script partially automatizes the obtainment of Indicators 004-007 from
# their database. It assumes an incremental updating of the data, and that the
# recent year of database is being manipulated. This indicator is the 
# Gross Expenditure in R&D (GERD), obtained from the survey and manually
# inputted (it comes from a results .pdf file).

# Load the required packages.
