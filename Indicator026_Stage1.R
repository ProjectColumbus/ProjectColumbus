# Script for DDEC Indicator 026
# Author: Gamaliel Lamboy Rodr√≠guez
# Version: 1.0
# Description:
# This script partially automatizes the obtainment of Indicator 026 from its 
# database. It assumes an incremental updating of the data, and that the most 
# recent year of database is being manipulated. This indicator measures the
# number of institutions with completions awarded in the CIP codes of the EAI.

filters = matrix( c("R Data Files", ".RData"), 1, 2, byrow = TRUE)

# The data is obtained directly from the results in Indicator 012.
load(tcltk::tk_choose.files(multi = FALSE, filters = filters))

# # Select the appropriate columns, and write file.
