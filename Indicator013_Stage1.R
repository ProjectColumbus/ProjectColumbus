# Script for DDEC Indicator 013
# Author: Gamaliel Lamboy Rodr√≠guez
# Version: 1.0
# Description:
# This script partially automatizes the obtainment of Indicator 013 from its 
# database. It assumes an incremental updating of the data, and that the most 
# recent year of database is being manipulated. This indicator re-expresses the
# information from Indicator 009 and calculates the shares of ICT employment in
# the Intangible Assets Economy.

# Data used is feeded and subsetted directly from the Indicator 009 results.
load( "../Indicator009/Stage3/database_indicator009_stage3.RData")

# Simplify the results.
dats1 <- dats3
dats3 <- dats1[, c("naics_code", "naics_title")]

# Create the indicator.
dats3$ICT_share <- sprintf("%1.1f%%", dats1$ICT_employees / 
dats1$total_employees * 100)

# Write the final results.
write.csv(dats3, "./Stage3/results_indicator013_stage3.csv", row.names = F)
