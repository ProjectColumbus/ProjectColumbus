# Script for DDEC Indicator 010
# Author: Gamaliel Lamboy Rodr√≠guez
# Version: 1.0
# Description:
# This script partially automatizes the obtainment of Indicator 010 from its 
# database. It assumes an incremental updating of the data, and that the most 
# recent year of database is being manipulated. This indicator shows the
# educational attainment by age cohorts, as obtained from the Census data in
# .xls(x) files.

# Preload additional packages to use.
library("openxlsx")

# Parameters used to read the data.
