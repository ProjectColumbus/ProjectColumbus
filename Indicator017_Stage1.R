# Script for DDEC Indicator 017
# Author: Gamaliel Lamboy Rodr√≠guez
# Version: 1.0
# Description:
# This script partially automatizes the obtainment of Indicator 017 from its 
# database. It assumes an incremental updating of the data, and that the most 
# recent year of database is being manipulated. This indicator shows the
# patent distribution by type of patent and the total count for a particular
# year.

# Preload additional packages to use.
library("openxlsx")

# Parameters used to read the original data.
PARAMS <- list(
sheet = 1,
startRow = 1,
cols = 1:9,
detectDates = FALSE,
rowNames = FALSE,
colNames = TRUE
)

attach(PARAMS)

# Read the original data.
dats1 <- do.call(read.xlsx, c( PARAMS, list(
xlsxFile = "./Original_Data/Indicator 017 Database.xlsx")))

detach(PARAMS)

dats3 <- dats1

# Create column with grand total, which includes both patents and statutory
# intervention registrations (SIRs).
dats3[,max(PARAMS$cols) + 1] <- rowSums( sapply(dats1[,c(4:9)], as.numeric), 
na.rm = T)

# Names were only changed in the dataset with created columns.
colnames(dats3) <- scan(what = "", sep = "\n", file = "./Stage1/Changed_Names")

# Select and subset the data.
dats3 <- unlist(dats1[ dats1$code == "PR",grep("patents|total|sirs", 
colnames(dats1))])

# Write the final results.
