# Script for DDEC Indicator 012
# Author: Gamaliel Lamboy Rodr√≠guez
# Version: 1.0
# Description:
# This script partially automatizes the obtainment of Indicator 012 from its 
# database. It assumes an incremental updating of the data, and that the most 
# recent year of database is being manipulated. This indicator is the number
# of completions by type.

# Preload additional packages to use.

# Parameters used to read the original data.

# The original file has a composite index called "Variable", which
# needs to be split into different categories. This variable is a regex string
# which decomposes the index into each its components for referencing later.
# These are the components:

# 2. (First major) -- first_second_major (used)
# 3. (.+)\\, -- cip_description (used)
# 4. A combination of groups 5 and 6 (see below) (unused)
