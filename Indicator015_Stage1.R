# Script for DDEC Indicator 015
# Author: Gamaliel Lamboy Rodr√≠guez
# Version: 1.0
# Description:
# This script partially automatizes the obtainment of Indicator 015 from its 
# database. It assumes an incremental updating of the data, and that the most 
# recent year of database is being manipulated. This indicator is the
# distribution of households with/without a computer.

# Preload additional packages to use.
library("openxlsx")

# Parameters used to read the original data.

# Select the appropriate rows for the table. The row names were used instead
# of the original values as key fields, because the original fields relied
# on a multi-level outline and did not include all the relevant information
# for a particular data point ( they are understandable only through context
# and indentation).
