# Script for DDEC Indicator 018
# Author: Gamaliel Lamboy Rodr√≠guez
# Version: 1.0
# Description:
# This script partially automatizes the obtainment of Indicator 018 from its 
# database. It assumes an incremental updating of the data, and that the most 
# recent year of database is being manipulated. This indicator measures the
# academic and science output per 100,000 inhabitants, as obtained from the
# Current Population Survey and the National Science Foundation.

# Preload additional packages to use.

# This indicator has multiple sources, therefore PARAMS is a nested list,
# with each component having its respective parameters.

# Originally, it was thought that the data for component 3 only came in
# the form of a ratio of articles to 1,000 doctorate degree holders. 
# Therefore, component 2 was created to approximate the number of academic
# output, and then calculate the indicator. However, this is not the case,
# and the code now uses the academic output directly from the data.
dats3 <- as.matrix( dats2[[3]][,dats_yrs] / dats2[[1]][,dats_yrs] * 1e5 )

100,000 Inhabitants")
