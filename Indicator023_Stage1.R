# Script for DDEC Indicator 023
# Author: Gamaliel Lamboy Rodr√≠guez
# Version: 1.0
# Description:
# This script partially automatizes the obtainment of Indicator 023 from its
# database. It assumes an incremental updating of the data, and that the most
# recent year of database is being manipulated. Time trends are handled by a
# master script. However, the resulting files are created so that they can
# afterwards be merged in a cumulative (time-series) dataset.
# The following script retrieves the number of economic firms currently
# operating in the economy.

# Preload additional packages to use.
library("tcltk")

# Data is obtained directly from the Indicator 002 Results, for obvious
# reasons.

# Beginning of Name Validation
# Some corps_900 firms split their structure into several Employer 
# Identification Numbers. However, for measurement purposes, they must
# be considered a single entity. In this part, a name validation procedure was
# implemented in order to aggregate the split entities by name into a single
# unit for measurement purposes. This procedure involves manual input, thus use
# of VERY simple GUI for information is done using the "tcltk" package in order
# to warn the user of these needed changes. This can be refined later.

# Create a data.frame with the following columns:
# fix - the firm names to be replaced by user input. Unchanged values are set
# as NA.
# legal_corporate_name - the original name of the firm.
# trade_name - trade names or "Doing Business as"
# EIN - the Employment Identification Number of each firm.
# NAICS - the 6-digit NAICS of each firm.
# emp_m[1-3] - the monthly employment level of each firm.
# tot_wages - the quarterly payroll of each firm.
x <- instance_list[[1]]

name_list900 <- data.frame( fix = rep(NA, nrow(x)), x[, c( "trade_name_DBA",
"legal_corporate_name", "EIN", "NAICS", grep("^emp_m[1-3]", colnames(x), 
value = T), "tot_wages")])

# Sort the rows by name of firm to ease the deduplication process.
name_list900 <- name_list900[ order( name_list900$legal_corporate_name),]

# Outputting to Stage2 folder, awaiting input from user.
write.csv( name_list900, "./Stage2/name_list900_cleanup.csv", 
row.names = FALSE)

# Warning message, explaining the reasons and the expected output. Since
# multi-line strings are not supported in R, a "gsub" routine was developed to
# mark the newline characters which needed to be eliminated with the symbol
# 'a\n'.

paste( gsub("a\n", " ", "Large firms often create multiple legal structures toa
organize their establishments. However, for economic purposes they should bea
considered a single entity. Please replace the NAs in \"fix\" of thea
legal/corporate names that will be considered as a single firm with a uniquea
identifier. For example:

fix   legal_corporate_name  trade_name
ATT   ATT Puerto Rico       AT&T Puerto Rico
ATT   ATT Mobility          AT&T Mobility Puerto Rico

Sometimes the legal/corporate names are unusable from the original data. Ina
this case, a similar process must be done relative to the trade name ora
\"Doing Business As\" of a firm, as is shown in the third line.
